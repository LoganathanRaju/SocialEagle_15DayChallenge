Yesterday (September 4), Rajinikanth’s Coolie wrapped up its third week at the Indian box office. After a solid opening week, the film lost its steam during the second week, and as expected, the third week saw a massive drop. The verdict is already out, and the magnum opus has emerged as a failure, but amid this, there’s something to cheer about, as it has recorded the superstar’s third-best week 3 collection. Keep reading for a detailed report of day 22!



How much did Coolie earn at the Indian box office in 22 days?

The Kollywood action thriller had everything working in its favor, but unfortunately, it couldn’t capitalize on it. It had big credentials involved, but the film failed to deliver appealing content. Due to mixed word-of-mouth, it saw a massive drop of 81.77% during the second week. During the first week, it scored a solid 229.65 crores, followed by just 41.85 crores in the second week.

Overall, it has earned 284.02 crore net at the Indian box office. Including GST, the gross domestic collection stands at 335.14 crores.
